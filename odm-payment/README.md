# Git Commit Syntax Error Resolution

## Problem Identified
You're encountering an error when trying to commit changes to your Git repository. The error message indicates that Git is interpreting parts of your commit message as file paths:

```
error: pathspec 'payment' did not match any file(s) known to git
error: pathspec 'odm'' did not match any file(s) known to git
```

## Root Cause
The issue is with the syntax of your commit command. When you used:
```
git commit -m 'add payment odm' -n
```

Git interpreted this incorrectly because of how the quotes are being processed. The single quotes around your commit message aren't being properly recognized, causing Git to interpret 'payment' and 'odm'' as file paths rather than as part of your commit message.

## Solution

### Option 1: Use double quotes for the commit message
```
git commit -m "add payment odm" -n
```

### Option 2: Place the -n flag before the -m flag
```
git commit -n -m 'add payment odm'
```

### Option 3: Escape the single quotes or avoid special characters
If your commit message contains special characters or apostrophes, use double quotes or escape them:
```
git commit -m "add payment odm's features" -n
```

## Why This Works
The correct syntax ensures that Git properly interprets the entire text within quotes as your commit message, rather than as file paths to be committed.

## Additional Information
Your `git status` shows that you have several new files staged for commit in the `odm-payment` directory. These files are ready to be committed once you use the correct commit command syntax.

## Next Steps
After successfully committing your changes, you can push them to your remote repository with:
```
git push origin main
```
